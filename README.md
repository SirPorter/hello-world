# hello-world

My name is Michael Porter and I realized that there was so much more to technology than what I'd buried myself into. I come from a Systems Engineering / System Administrator background. I was promoted several times and ended up an Associate Director. I realized that there was so much out here that I was missing. I love setting the direction of an organization, but I also miss rolling up my sleeves and getting in the weeds.
I really enjoy traveling and learning about different cultures. Interacting with people from different corners of the world fills my happiness tank.
My family is the most important thing to me. My parents are divorced, but I have to admit that my relationship with each of them has grown significantly now that I am an adult. I've always had a terrific relationship with each parent, but now I consider them best friends, confidants, trusted advisors, as well as my parents.
I'm currently refreshing my personal technology skillset. I plan on diving back into Python, upgrading some old tech certifications, and learning a new skills.
